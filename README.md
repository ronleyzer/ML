# ML

Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation Project.


## Download the Data from GoogleDrive

Download the 'data' folder using the following link: [My_GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pohCzjaTY1ZTzqvKXm8KPB2pC6BEuovB).
Put the data in a folder on your computer.

## Clone the Project
Clone the project
```bash
https://github.com/ronleyzer/ML.git
```

## Installation
I used Python 3.9.1 to create this project.
Use the terminal or command line to install the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code
Assuming that (for example):
1. You are running anomaly_detection.py 
2. The ML folder is in C:\Users\ronro\PycharmProjects
3. The data folder is in C:\Users\ronro\Desktop

First option   - Run the code using the command line- 
Run the following command:
```python
python C:\Users\ronro\PycharmProjects\ML\algorithms\anomaly_and_outliers\anomaly_detection.py --path_in "C:\Users\ronro\Desktop\data"
```

Second option - Run the code using the configuration:
```python
# Go to "Edit Configurations" in PyCharm
# Add to the parameters the location of the data folder you just downloaded
--path_in "C:\Users\ronro\Desktop\data"
# Then press Run
```
